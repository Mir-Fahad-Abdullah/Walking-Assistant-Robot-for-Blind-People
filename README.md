# Walking Assistant Robot for Blind People

## Introduction
Visually impaired individuals face significant challenges in navigating their environment safely. Traditional mobility aids like white canes and guide dogs are helpful but have limitations in detecting obstacles at different heights, providing real-time guidance, or understanding complex environments. With advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, and sensor technologies, smart assistive devices are emerging as a promising solution. This project proposes a walking assistant robot leveraging deep learning-based real-time object detection, sensors, and Bangla voice guidance to aid blind individuals in navigation.
